# Homework №1  
## Variant №5  

### Task  
Create a mathematical functions module: `dk_tool.h` (.c).  

In `main.c`, organize input/output of parameters—console input/output is not mandatory.  

Avoid code duplication—if there are repeating code segments, they should be moved to separate functions, such as:  
- Printing an array to the console  
- Filling a matrix/array  
- Inputting data from the terminal with validation, etc.  

Find the transposed matrix.
